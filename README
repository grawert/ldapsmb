ldapsmb can be used on Samba servers with LDAP backend to manage users, groups,
and computers in a LDAP directory. ldapsmb only needs python and python-ldap
packages to be installed on your system.

There is no support for LM passwords. LM passwords are used by Windows 95/98.
Windows clients starting from NT4 to current versions do not use LM passwords.

--- Installation

Make sure python and python-ldap packages are installed

SUSE: 
# zypper install python python-ldap
Redhat:
# yum install python python-ldap
Debian:
# apt-get install python-ldap

Copy ldapsmb and ldapsmb.conf on Samba server:

# cp ldapsmb /etc/samba/ldapsmb 
# cp ldapsmb.conf /etc/samba/ldapsmb.conf

Edit ldapsmb.conf for your LDAP server. Be careful not to use any tabs in 
front of the paramters.

/etc/samba/ldapsmb.conf:
